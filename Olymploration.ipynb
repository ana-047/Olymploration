    "Rooted in rich history, symbolism and values associated with the Olympic games, Olympic medals are considered highly prestigious, often representing the pinnacle of athletic achievement. Winning an Olympic medal is a recognition of excellence on the international stage, and it often holds cultural and national significance. It is an opportunity for athletes from all nations, big or small, to transcend national boundaries and compete together. This tradition began in 1896 in Athens, Greece and with the exception of the games not being held due to the two world wars, the Summer games have been held every 4 years. The first Winter Olympics were held in Chamonix, France, in 1924. The goal of this project is to predict which country wins the most medals at the Olympic games. \n",

Capilla would improve to a silver medal in 1952, behind Lee, and then win the platform gold medal at Melbourne in 1956.\\nLee made it to the top as a diver despite overcoming racial discrimination as a Korean-American. Growing up in Fresno, California, Latinos, Asians and African-Americans were only allowed to use Fresno’s public Brookside Pool on Wednesdays, on what was called “international day,” which was the day before the pool was scheduled to be drained and refilled with clean water. To allow him to practice on other days, his coach dug a pit in his backyard and filled it with sand, and Lee practiced by jumping into the pit.\\n</td>\n",

On the first slalom run, France’s Jean-Pierre Vidal, third in the 2001-02 World Cup standings, took the lead over the top American, Bode Miller, with Raich in third and Kostelić in fourth. On the second run, Miller caught a gate early and did not finish. The best second run was posted by Vidal’s teammate, Sébastien Amiez, who had been equal eighth after the first run. He was followed by British Scot Alain Baxter, who moved up from a tie with Amiez on the first run. Vidal placed sixth on the second run, good enough to keep him in the lead and win the gold medal, Amiez placing second, and Baxter apparently winning Britain’s first-ever medal in Alpine skiing.\\nBut Baxter had a positive doping test for methamphetamine, the result of using an over-the-counter nasal spray. He was disqualified and Benjamin Raich moved up to the bronze medal position. Baxter appealed his doping positive to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, and was cleared of any intentional attempt at using PEDs, which lifted the potential two-year ban from competition, but he was still disqualified in the Olympic slalom.\\n</td>\n",

Mazin won the gold medal with the best lift in both snatch and clean & jerk, although his jerk was matched by Bulgaria’s Stefan Dimitrov, who won silver. The bronze medal went to Poland’s Marek Seweryn, who had been the 1979 World Champion and a silver medalist in 1978 as a bantamweight.\\n   \n",

Lee had finished third earlier in London on the springboard, which was won by Bruce Harlan, who placed second to Lee in this event. Lee would return in four years at Helsinki and defend his gold medal on platform. The bronze went to Mexican Joaquín Capilla, who had only been fifth in the preliminaries. Capilla would improve to a silver medal in 1952, behind Lee, and then win the platform gold medal at Melbourne in 1956.\\nLee made it to the top as a diver despite overcoming racial discrimination as a Korean-American. Growing up in Fresno, California, Latinos, Asians and African-Americans were only allowed to use Fresno’s public Brookside Pool on Wednesdays, on what was called “international day,” which was the day before the pool was scheduled to be drained and refilled with clean water. To allow him to practice on other days, his coach dug a pit in his backyard and filled it with sand, and Lee practiced by jumping into the pit.\\n   \n",

       "4  The last few World Cups had gone to Austrian Benjamin Raich and Norwegian superstar Kjetil André Aamodt, but leading the 2001-2002 World Cup race was Croatian Ivica Kostelić, brother of Janica Kostelić, who would win three Alpine gold medals at the 2002 Winter Olympics. On the first slalom run, France’s Jean-Pierre Vidal, third in the 2001-02 World Cup standings, took the lead over the top American, Bode Miller, with Raich in third and Kostelić in fourth. On the second run, Miller caught a gate early and did not finish. The best second run was posted by Vidal’s teammate, Sébastien Amiez, who had been equal eighth after the first run. He was followed by British Scot Alain Baxter, who moved up from a tie with Amiez on the first run. Vidal placed sixth on the second run, good enough to keep him in the lead and win the gold medal, Amiez placing second, and Baxter apparently winning Britain’s first-ever medal in Alpine skiing.\\nBut Baxter had a positive doping test for methamphetamine, the result of using an over-the-counter nasal spray. He was disqualified and Benjamin Raich moved up to the bronze medal position. Baxter appealed his doping positive to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, and was cleared of any intentional attempt at using PEDs, which lifted the potential two-year ban from competition, but he was still disqualified in the Olympic slalom.\\n   \n",

    "The base LR model using 2020 data performs best in terms of MSE, especially when dropping the US as a country. The magnitude of the errors is lower, and the number of medals predicted go from being off by 6.5 to 6.3 (decimals are a result of using a linear regression model on count data). However, the difference between the train and test MSEs in the second fitting that drops the USA is larger. Since such a significant outlier was removed, the model is perhaps overfitting on noise that it can now better perceive. Some collinearity between variables like contingent size and event count, prior medals and previous year medals, etc. could also contribute. The R2 for the fitting without the USA is lower than that of the first, possibly because removing a row of data in a small dataset can cause information loss that affects the overall goodness of fit. Meanwhile, the base model applied to all years performs the worst, with a larger difference in train-test scores and generally worse metrics. \n",
    "\n",
    "Considering that the assumptions of linear regression are violated (e.g. heteroscedasticity, independence of observations, possible collinearity, etc.), this base model performs well. Going forward, it will be important to address the time component of the data (whether it means focusing on a smaller dataset or using all years) and the treatment of outliers like the USA (e.g., taking the log may improve the model). Moreover, since the model performs well initially, the possibilty of information leakage exists; the model may be capable of inferring a certain year's medal count based on the medal counts available for that year in the training data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Data size is another aspect: if only one year is used, the data shrinks to around 80 rows, which is not a robust number. We may need to explore data generation/oversampling techniques, or find a time-series appropriate solution that allows the use of more years. In terms of modelling, we look forward to exploring methods for count data, such as random forest, gradient boosting, poisson regression, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "This base model furnishes a first glimpse of the feature importances. Being a host increases the medal tally by 1.5, all things equal, while winter seems to decrease it by 1.1. Previous year medals and contingent size also have a somewhat smaller, positive contribution. Applied to 2020 data, the important features become the number of events partaken in. Interestingly, the sign switches for 2016_medals after removing the USA; they are decreasing the the medals won by a country in 2020. We are currently working on adding more variables, for example related to climate, pollution, distance to the host country, etc. These are country inherent characteristics that are likely to impact the performance of athletes and in turn, the total medals. \n",

    "    <p> Time series modelling is an extensive field and goes beyond the scope of this course. However, without accounting for the time components in our data, our models will not approximate reality. Our strategy is therefore to turn this time series problem into a supervised learning one by incorporating time features that account for the correlations to prior periods. \n",
    "<br><br>To begin, we must create train and test sets. Splitting the data into train and test sets considers more caution for time series problems. \n",
    "        The baseline linear regression model was leaking data from the train set into the test set, as splitting had been done using the tradional 80/20 train/test split implementation from Scikit Learn. Information from the year of prediction was in the train set, meaning information about the Olympic Games at the time of prediction that would normally be impossible to know (since the event hasn't occured) was used. Consequently, the baseline model's good performance came from overfitting, especially considering that none of the assumptions of linear regression were met. \n",
    "To mitigate this effect, we considered 3 time series splitting techniques:<li> Rolling window: using a T (time of prediction)-1 train set to predict T (validation data). The data is split into several folds of T-1 training data and T validation data.\n",
    "    <li>Expanding/Rolling window: starting with T (time of prediction)-1 as the train set and using the previous year's validation data (T) as the train once the next prediction period (T+1) arrives. The train set for that new prediction period T+1 not just include T-1, but also T-2. The train set grows cumulatively with every fold, until T-n. </li></p>\n",
    "    We chose to use an expanding window due to a limited validation set size (x=1032), meaning only 200 observations per fold if split evenly. Moreover, historical occurences may have impact on future medal count, and it is useful to see how the model performs when predicting year-on-year in the first fold, as opposed to year-on-past in the last fold. \n",
    "<br><br> In addition, cross validation is different for time series as the test set should be kept out of the train for that given year. Sectioning the data into equally sized blocks does not work. Instead, we will compare the performance for each validation fold. Since each fold is trained on a different number of years, it provides a good cross validation benchmark.\n",

Poisson is a viable alternative as it assumes count data that occurs in fixed time intervals. However, it also requires an equal mean and variance, which will have to be verified. If the variance is greater than the mean (known as overdispersion), negative binomial regression relaxes the assumption and can be used when the data has extra variability.

    "Overdispersion occurs when the variability in the data is greater than what is expected by the assumed statistical model. However, since the predictions are much worse than the previous models, the cause is unclear. Perhaps if overdispersion is severe, the model might overestimate the uncertainty in predictions, leading to wider prediction intervals and overestimations. Multicollinearity and outliers could also be a cause, yet this would equally manifest in the previous 2 models. Research suggests that this model is sensitive to scale, since the pattern of dispersion is critically dependent on it. We will test these in the coming sections.\n",

    "The most gentle transformation is the square root. While it reduces the extreme skew that most predictors exhibit, it does not alter the distribution shape drastically. In contrast, the log transformation has the greatest impact and will even move the skew to the other side. The Box-Cox is better at creating the most normal-approximation, yet also seems to extreme in some cases. <br><br> We may use the square root transformation. However, we will attempt scaling instead as it does not directly alter the distribution but can soften the impact of outliers/extreme values. Instead of standardizing, which would not help address the outliers, Scikit Learn's Robust Scaler can be used. Robust scaling  is less influenced by extreme values as it uses the median (rather than the mean) and interquartile range to calculate the scale. These statistics are less sensitive to outliers compared to the mean and standard deviation used in standardization. </div>\n"

    "    One of the main limitations of this work is that it does not address decimal predictions. Since the data is in counts, yet most models do not accomodate it, we did not predict in full medal values. One option would be to round down, since most models were likelier to overpredict. However, this should be researched accordingly. \n",
    "    <br><br>Another limitation is that cross validation is not identical in time series data. While we created appropriate validation folds, comparing the train data to the test is problematic. It is not common to check model performance on the training data in time series, as we are predicting into the future: T-n is used to predict T, not the other way around. Assessing issues like overfitting therefore became more complicated and was not addressed sufficiently in this work. <br><br>The overprediction issue of the GLMs was never sufficiently solved. Though this project attempted to scale and transform accordingly, the results were not as expected. \n",
    "    <br><br> Throughout this project, the feature importance was obtained through various methods. When many features were involved, coefficients were close to zero for several, though they were not turned off completely (due to the bootstrapping). In order to gain more understanding for which features are acceptable to remove, forward feature selection would have been useful. \n",
    "    <br><br> One of the main shortcomings of this project is the way in which MSEs are compared. Though we take the average of all cross validation folds in order to stay robust, it was apparent that the first two folds performed poorly. Though this is part of cross validation, in time series, it may make sense to limit the validation window if it is better suited to the problem at hand. Based on what we observed, one year into the past or even 8 is not sufficient. Since there is enough data, we recommend this prediction problem is readdressed using a different scoring methodology, or cross validation approach."
